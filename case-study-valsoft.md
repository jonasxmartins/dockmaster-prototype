Situation 
As part of your role at Valsoft as the AI Venture Builder, you’ve been assigned to evaluate one of our portfolio companies to identify opportunities for AI-driven product development and commercialization. For this case, your focus is DockMaster, a business operating in the maritime software sector.  

Company Overview 
For decades maritime management teams used spreadsheets, paper logs, and disconnected tools that slowed workflows, caused delays, and created costly mistakes that reduced both time and revenue. DockMaster gives modern marine businesses a digital solution that helps them operate faster, more accurately, and with less effort. DockMaster replaces manual processes with marine digital tools, organizing and centralizing data, automating repetitive tasks, and providing managers with real-time insights that improve decisions across every aspect of operations. For hundreds of marinas, DockMaster is the primary system of record for financial and operational functions including sales, inventory, accounting, maintenance and services.
